Useful dotfiles for your Linux env

Please make a copy of your existing dotfiles as this may overwrite them

Install by running this command to pull the files into your ~ home dir:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattpass/dotfiles/master/.bashrc && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattpass/dotfiles/master/.nanorc && ls -a
```

Once the files are in place, simply restart your CLI
